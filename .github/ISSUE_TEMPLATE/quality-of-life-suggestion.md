Suggest quality of life changes here. These should be small changes to existing aspects of the game. New features should be submitted as a feature request instead.

State the problem separate from any potential fixes. For example:

** Problem **
Attempting to get a mission from the governor often results in having to spam "mission", resulting in the chat being blocked.

** Potential fix **
Remove the chat block in the governor's office.
