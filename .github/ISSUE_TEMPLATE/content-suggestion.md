This template is for suggesting new content for the game. This is a free-form template, but a good place to start for what to include would be the map_edit.pdf file available in the game editor, quoted below to save time. Not all of these need to be included, but the more you include the better.

# SO YOU WANT TO BE A BUILDER?
## GUIDELINES FOR AREA-DESIGN
1. Read the storyline
2. Decide on a level range for the new area.
3. (Re-)Play all existing areas in this level range, make note of the stories/puzzles/quests used.
4. Based on the storyline and the quests in the chosen level range, decide what story, quests and NPCs to use. Avoid repeating quest objectives and stories but make it fit in the general feeling.
5. Create a list of Quests. Then check if those quests need anything that has not been used before in terms of logic and graphics. If there is such a need, try to work around it. If you still think it needs something special, describe what it needs and way.
6. Once the story, quest summaries, NPC lists and specials are done, get down to specifics. Describe each quest in detail.
## CHECKLIST
You should have the following texts written:
1. A short summary of the story for the area.
2. A list of short descriptions of quests in the area, indicating quest objective, NPCs used and dungeon size and type.
3. A list of special logic and unique graphics.
4. A detailed description of each quest, including all texts spoken by NPCs, NPC descriptions, NPC stats (these should be limited to 'lvl 23, uses Hand to Hand, Bless and Fireball).
5. Maps of all dungeons which need a special design. Maps can (and should) be omitted if there is no puzzle or story element based on them.
